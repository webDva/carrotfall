# carrotfall
A tricky physics-rich game where the player catches falling carrots.

Heavily relies on Ashley Entity Component System and Box2D. I used them properly this time, I believe!

# Setup
Since it's a gradle project, I believe that all that you need to do to set up your own Carrotfall development environment and to build an .apk is, with Android Stuido, import the root directory.
